        <div class="article">
            <h2>The Chase of Montag Captivates the Nation</h2>
            <p>The events of last night have left the populace in a state of awe and disbelief as Guy Montag, once a proud fireman, became the subject of an unprecedented citywide manhunt. Montag's flight through the streets and into the unknown has drawn the attention of citizens and authorities alike. Pursued by the relentless Mechanical Hound, Montag's escape was nothing short of miraculous, demonstrating agility and determination in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>
            <p>Eyewitnesses reported seeing Montag sprinting through alleyways and residential areas, his silhouette illuminated by the flashing lights of government vehicles and the ever-present drone cameras. "It was like a scene out of a movie," commented one bystander. "The whole city seemed to hold its breath."</p>

        <div class="article">
            <h2>Captain Beatty Found Dead: Fire Chief Meets a Fiery End</h2>
            <p>In a twist that has shocked the Fire Department, Captain Beatty was pronounced dead late last night following a confrontation with Montag. Sources suggest that the disagreement between the two escalated rapidly, culminating in Montag wielding a flamethrower—a tool of his former trade—against his superior officer. The motive behind Montag's actions remains unclear, though speculation abounds about long-standing tensions and ideological conflicts between the two men.</p>
            <p>Authorities have labeled Montag as "armed and extremely dangerous," urging citizens to report any sightings immediately. Beatty's colleagues have expressed both grief and anger, with one describing him as "a true believer in the sanctity of fire and its role in maintaining societal order."</p>

            <h2>Opinion: A World Set Ablaze by Rebellion</h2>
            <p>Montag's actions may seem reckless, but they speak to a larger societal unrest. The events surrounding Beatty's death and Montag's escape raise critical questions about the oppressive state of our society. Are we truly safe, or is this illusion maintained by the suppression of free thought and expression? Montag's defiance, though tragic in its consequences, sheds light on the lengths individuals will go to for freedom.</p>
            <p>It is a stark reminder that fear and control can only mask dissent for so long. The Mechanical Hound, the firemen, and the surveillance drones are symbols of a regime desperate to maintain order. Perhaps it is time to question the cost of this order and whether the price of freedom is worth paying. In Montag's rebellion, there lies a cautionary tale—and perhaps, a spark of hope.</p>
